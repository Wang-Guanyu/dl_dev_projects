### Deep Learning Course Main Project

This is the main project for deep learning course, which aims for industrial inspection. The main project can be separated into two parts:

#### Personal Project 1:

Segment small particles from a noisy background with UNet.

Why we need this: In industrial, the defect detection and segmentation is important for us to distinguish good and bad samples.

Dataset: 150 images with defect and 150 defect labels for training; 150 images with defect for testing. 

#### Personal Project 2:

Generate new data with GAN model.

Why we need this: In industrial, some types of defects are unusual, if we want to train such kind of defects, the lack of samples might be a problem. Thus we use GAN to generate more dataset for training and testing.

Dataset: 100 images as ground truth input.
